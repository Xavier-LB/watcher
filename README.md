# slotwatcher

Watch for corrections in 42 intra.

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/t0mm4rx/42-correction-watcher.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/Z7VRW7)

## Features

- Deploy in one click on free tiers of different providers
- No need to keep the watcher running on your machine, deploy and take a break!
- Only sends one notification per slot, no more spam in your feed


## Theoretical roadmap

Let's stay real, we all know I wrote this to have fun during one evening and will likely abandon this project tomorrow.

But if I don't, or if you're a charitable comitter walking by, here's what would be cool to do:

- [ ] More providers (Render, I'm looking at you)
- [ ] More notification providers (notably ntfy.sh)
- [ ] A CLI module installed via Go, notified via the terminal
